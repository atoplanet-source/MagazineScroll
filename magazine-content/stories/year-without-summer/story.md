In April 1815, Mount Tambora in Indonesia exploded in the largest volcanic eruption in recorded history. The blast killed an estimated seventy thousand people immediately, but its true impact would unfold over the following year.

Tambora ejected so much ash and sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere that it created a global climate catastrophe.

The following year, 1816, became known as the Year Without Summer. In New England, frost occurred in every month. Snow fell in June. Crops failed across Europe and North America. Food prices soared. Horses starved because there was no hay. In some regions, people ate rats and grass to survive.

The human cost was staggering. Famine spread across the Northern Hemisphere. Typhus epidemics followed in the wake of malnutrition. In Switzerland, the situation was so desperate that the government declared a national emergency.

It was in this context that a group of writers gathered at the Villa Diodati near Lake Geneva. Trapped indoors by the endless cold rain, they challenged each other to write ghost stories. Mary Shelley, then eighteen years old, began writing Frankenstein. Her tale of a creature brought to life through science, only to be abandoned by its creator, was shaped by the apocalyptic atmosphere of that strange summer.

Lord Byron wrote a poem about darkness consuming the world. The volcanic winter had created the perfect conditions for gothic horror.

Sometimes global catastrophe produces unexpected art.
