In the factories of New Jersey and Illinois during the 1920s, young women painted watch dials with luminous radium paint, making timepieces that glowed in the dark. The work paid well, three times what a typical factory job offered, and the women considered themselves lucky.

Their supervisors taught them a technique called lip-pointing: dip the brush in radium paint, bring it to your lips to shape a fine point, then apply the paint to the tiny dial numbers. Repeat hundreds of times per day.

The radium made them shimmer. They painted it on their fingernails for parties. They brushed it on their teeth to surprise their boyfriends with glowing smiles. They had no idea they were poisoning themselves with every stroke.

Within a few years, the women began falling ill. Their teeth loosened and fell out. Their jaws crumbled and had to be removed. Their bones honeycombed with holes as the radium replaced calcium in their skeletons. Some developed cancers so aggressive their tumors burst through their skin.

The company knew radium was dangerous. Male scientists and executives handled the material with lead screens and protective equipment. But the dial painters were considered expendable. When they got sick, the company blamed them, claiming they had contracted syphilis to discredit their testimony.

In 1927, five dying women filed suit against the United States Radium Corporation. The case drew national attention. Newspapers dubbed them the Radium Girls. They won their case, though most died within a few years of their victory.

Their fight established the right of workers to sue employers for damages caused by unsafe working conditions, laying the foundation for modern occupational health law.
