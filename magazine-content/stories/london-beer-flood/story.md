On October 17, 1814, a twenty-two-foot-tall wooden vat of beer ruptured at the Meux and Company Brewery in London. The force of the escaping liquid knocked loose the valve on an adjacent vat. Within minutes, over 135,000 gallons of beer flooded into the streets of the St. Giles rookery, one of London's poorest neighborhoods.

The wave of porter, a dark brown ale, reached fifteen feet in height as it crashed through the narrow streets. It demolished two houses and breached the wall of a basement where a family was holding a wake for a two-year-old boy who had died the previous day. The mourners, trapped in the cellar, drowned in beer.

In total, eight people died. Seven were women and children. The youngest victim was three years old.

In the aftermath, crowds gathered to scoop up the free beer. Some brought pots and pans. Others simply cupped their hands.

The brewery was later taken to court but found not guilty of any wrongdoing. The disaster was ruled an act of God. Meux and Company successfully petitioned Parliament for a refund on the taxes they had paid for the lost beer.

The wooden vats were eventually replaced with lined concrete vessels. The St. Giles rookery, already one of London's most notorious slums, continued to deteriorate until it was eventually demolished for urban renewal.

The beer flood is largely forgotten today, a strange footnote in London's history. But for the families who lost loved ones to a wave of porter on an autumn afternoon, it was a tragedy beyond imagination.
