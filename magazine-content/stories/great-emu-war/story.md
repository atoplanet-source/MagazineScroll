In 1932, the Australian government declared war on emus. This is not a metaphor. The Royal Australian Artillery deployed soldiers armed with Lewis guns to the wheat-farming regions of Western Australia, where an estimated twenty thousand emus were destroying crops.

The birds had migrated inland after breeding season, following their ancient routes, only to discover that the land had been transformed into farmland. To them, the wheat fields were an endless buffet.

The farmers were desperate. Many were veterans of World War I who had been given land grants as reward for their service. They had struggled through drought and the Great Depression, and now watched helplessly as flocks of six-foot-tall birds devoured their livelihood.

The military operation began in November. It was a disaster from the start. Emus, it turns out, are remarkably difficult to kill. They can run at thirty miles per hour and seem almost indifferent to bullets. The birds would scatter at the first shots, regroup, and return from a different direction.

After six days, the soldiers had used 2,500 rounds of ammunition and killed perhaps 200 birds. The emus had won.

A second attempt later that month fared slightly better but still fell far short of expectations. The official military report noted that the emus had displayed guerrilla tactics and that each pack seemed to have its own leader who kept watch while the others fed.

The soldiers withdrew. The farmers were left to build fences. The emus continue to thrive in Australia to this day, a reminder that nature doesn't always cooperate with human plans.
