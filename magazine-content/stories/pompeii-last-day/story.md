On the morning of August 24, 79 CE, Pompeii was an ordinary Roman city of perhaps twenty thousand people. Merchants opened their shops. Bakers fired their ovens. Children played in the streets while their parents went about the business of daily life. By nightfall, Pompeii would cease to exist.

Mount Vesuvius had been rumbling for days, but the residents weren't alarmed. Earthquakes were common in the region. They had no way of knowing that pressure had been building beneath the mountain for centuries, that the stone plug sealing the volcano's throat was about to give way.

At approximately one in the afternoon, Vesuvius exploded with the force of a hundred thousand atomic bombs. A column of superheated ash and pumice shot nineteen miles into the sky, spreading like a vast umbrella over the bay. Day became absolute darkness.

The first phase of the eruption lasted eighteen hours. Pumice rained down on Pompeii at a rate of six inches per hour, collapsing roofs under its weight. Those who fled early, carrying what they could, survived. Those who stayed to protect their property, or simply waited too long to decide, found themselves trapped.

At six-thirty the following morning, the eruption entered its final, deadliest phase. A pyroclastic surge, a ground-hugging avalanche of superheated gas and ash traveling at over a hundred miles per hour, swept down the mountainside and through the city. Death came in seconds. The temperature was high enough to instantly boil blood and vaporize flesh.

When the ash finally settled, Pompeii lay buried under twenty feet of volcanic debris, perfectly preserved for seventeen centuries until workers digging a canal rediscovered its ruins.
