On May 23, 1618, a group of Protestant nobles marched into Prague Castle to confront the Catholic regents appointed by the Habsburg emperor. The meeting did not go well.

After a heated argument about religious freedom, the nobles seized two of the regents and their secretary and threw them out of a third-story window. All three men survived the seventy-foot fall. Catholics claimed they were saved by angels or by the Virgin Mary herself. Protestants pointed out that they had landed in a pile of manure.

This act of political violence, known as the Defenestration of Prague, triggered the Thirty Years' War, one of the most destructive conflicts in European history. The war would eventually involve most of the major powers on the continent and kill an estimated eight million people, many of them civilians who died from famine and disease.

The word defenestration means throwing someone out of a window. Prague has a particular history with this form of protest. An earlier defenestration in 1419 sparked the Hussite Wars. A later one in 1948 killed the Czechoslovak foreign minister Jan Masaryk, possibly murdered by communists. Something about that city and its windows.

The 1618 defenestration reminds us how quickly regional disputes can spiral into continental catastrophes. A broken window in Bohemia led to three decades of war that reshaped the political map of Europe and established the principle of state sovereignty that still governs international relations today.
