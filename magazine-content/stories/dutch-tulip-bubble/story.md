In February 1637, a single tulip bulb sold for more than ten times a skilled craftsman's annual salary. The flower had arrived in Europe only decades earlier, carried from the Ottoman Empire by diplomats and merchants who recognized its strange beauty. By the time it reached the Netherlands, the tulip had become something more than a flower. It was a status symbol, a marker of wealth and taste among Amsterdam's rising merchant class.

The rarest varieties commanded prices that seem absurd even today. A single Semper Augustus bulb, with its distinctive crimson streaks on white petals, could purchase a grand house on Amsterdam's most fashionable canal.

Speculators began trading futures contracts on bulbs still buried in the ground, buying and selling flowers that wouldn't bloom for months. Taverns became trading floors. Fortunes changed hands over drinks.

Then, on February 3rd, at a routine auction in Haarlem, something unprecedented happened. The buyers simply didn't show up. Within hours, panic spread through every trading house in the country. Prices collapsed by ninety percent in a matter of days. Men who had been wealthy at breakfast found themselves ruined by dinner.

The tulip crash became history's first recorded speculative bubble, a template for every financial mania that would follow. We've seen the pattern repeat with South Sea shares, railway stocks, dot-com companies, and cryptocurrency. The lesson, it seems, is one we're destined to learn again and again.
