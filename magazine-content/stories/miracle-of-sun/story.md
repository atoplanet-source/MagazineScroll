On October 13, 1917, an estimated seventy thousand people gathered in a muddy field near Fatima, Portugal. They had come because three young shepherd children claimed that the Virgin Mary had been appearing to them since May, and had promised a miracle on this date.

Most were devout Catholics. Some were skeptics, including journalists who had come to expose what they assumed would be a fraud.

It had been raining all morning. The crowd stood in thick mud, many having traveled for days on foot to reach this remote location. At noon, the rain stopped. The clouds parted. And then, according to multiple eyewitness accounts, the sun began to behave impossibly.

Witnesses described the sun spinning, zigzagging across the sky, and plunging toward the earth before returning to its normal position. Colors radiated outward, painting the landscape in shifting hues of red, yellow, and violet. People fell to their knees in prayer. Others screamed in terror, convinced the world was ending.

The event lasted approximately ten minutes. When it ended, people noticed that their clothes, which had been soaked through, were completely dry.

Newspaper accounts from the time corroborate these descriptions, including reports from anticlerical publications that had no interest in promoting religious claims. Scientists have proposed various explanations: atmospheric phenomena, mass hallucination, staring at the sun causing optical effects. None fully account for all the reported details.

The Catholic Church investigated for thirteen years before declaring the apparitions worthy of belief. Whatever happened at Fatima that day, seventy thousand people saw something they couldn't explain.
