The Library of Alexandria held an estimated four hundred thousand scrolls, representing nearly everything the ancient world had ever written down. Founded in the third century BCE under the Ptolemaic dynasty, it was designed to be the repository of all human knowledge.

Ships entering Alexandria's harbor were searched by royal decree. Any scrolls found aboard were confiscated and copied. The originals went to the library. The copies were returned to their owners.

Scholars from across the Mediterranean made pilgrimages to its reading rooms. Euclid wrote his Elements there, establishing the foundations of geometry that would endure for millennia. Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth using nothing but shadows and simple mathematics, arriving at a figure remarkably close to modern measurements. Aristarchus proposed that the Earth revolved around the sun, an idea that wouldn't gain acceptance for another eighteen hundred years.

The library's destruction wasn't the sudden catastrophe we often imagine. It died slowly, over centuries, through a combination of fires, funding cuts, and shifting priorities. Julius Caesar's troops accidentally burned part of it during a siege. Christian mobs damaged the connected temple complex during religious riots. The Muslim conquest may have finished what remained, though historians still debate the details.

What haunts us isn't just the loss of books. It's the loss of books we don't even know existed. Entire philosophical schools, complete histories of vanished civilizations, scientific treatises that might have accelerated human progress by centuries. All gone, leaving only fragments and references in texts that survived by accident.
