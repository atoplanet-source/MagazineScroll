In July 1518, a woman named Frau Troffea stepped into a narrow street in Strasbourg and began to dance. There was no music. No celebration. She simply danced, her feet moving in a compulsive rhythm she seemed unable to control. She danced through the afternoon and into the evening. She danced until her shoes wore through and her feet bled. She danced until she collapsed from exhaustion, only to rise and begin again.

Within a week, thirty-four people had joined her. Within a month, the number had grown to four hundred.

The city council, baffled by the phenomenon, consulted physicians who declared that the afflicted were suffering from overheated blood. The cure, they decided, was more dancing. Musicians were hired to play faster and louder. A wooden stage was constructed so the dancers could perform more freely. Guildhalls were opened around the clock to accommodate the growing crowds.

It only made things worse. Historical records suggest dozens died before the plague mysteriously ended in September, nearly two months after it began. The dancers simply stopped, as suddenly as they had started, and returned to their normal lives.

Modern historians believe the dancing plague was a case of mass psychogenic illness, a physical manifestation of extreme psychological stress. Strasbourg had suffered years of famine, bitter winters, and outbreaks of smallpox. The people were desperate, traumatized, and searching for any form of release.

The dancing plague reminds us that the mind can break the body in ways we still don't fully understand, and that collective trauma can manifest in the strangest possible ways.
